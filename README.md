# Kathleen-Cater
Design approach for Find My iPhone assignment:
- Kept the design simple
- Color theme stayed green throughout like on iPhone app
- Made the button turn green when activated to indicate a successful login
- Kept the warning button at the top of the screen in a different color, gray, to represent an error
